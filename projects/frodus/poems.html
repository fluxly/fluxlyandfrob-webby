<h2>THAT SUMMER</h2>


the lilacs shivered; <br>
a moist breese bedewed them<br>
with shiny beads<br>
like so many crustaceous anomalies.<br>
a grim bird smirked<br>
a dripping grapefruit grin<br>
and a suckled babe's lipsy grumble<br>
smeared the silence.<br>
the boyish murm'rous fragrance<br>
of the bees bumbling<br>
'mongst the tranquil jonquils<br>
subduded and humbled <br>
the piebald magpie:<br>
he surrendered in sluggish servitude <br>
and offered a whimsical symphony.<br>
that summer<br>
seemed to me <br>
an effervescent procession<br>
of sundry melodious<br>
watermelon mondays.<p>

<A NAME="2"><h2>Dr. Ignatius and his Coal Beast</h2></A>



A sooty coal wonder, this robot, <br>
this mechanical beast that crunches and sputters <br>
and spits smoke across Scotland's bonnie hillsides - <br>
some would believe the story hatched by the local rubbie-dubbies <br>
and some would sooner collectively thumb their noses at you.  <br>
It's distant now, it's a screechy cry let high; <br>
I check the baggage in the van, <br>
especially the sound equipment we have lugged from the airport <br>
to the hotel and the cameras that would let us take <br>
6&quot;x10&quot; Kodacolor glossies of the monstrosity.  <br>
It's Quite clear this afternoon and the boxes and <br>
their corresponding men -whi are tired- rise to the occassion <br>
with lonely speed, the Coal Beast of Dr. Ignatius makes its highland path, <br>
leaving black soot and tread marks.  <br>
The creator, the man, Dr. Ignatius is hunting the beast <br>
through deserted forests and populous towns by El Camino <br>
with mounted gunrack hoping to find it and DESTROY it <br>
(He'll come out bravely in the final drafts).  <br>
We interview the local rubbie-dubbies at the pub <br>
&quot;Claymore!  Claymore!&quot; cries one red-beard face; <br>
&quot;Remember!  Remember!&quot; screams another.  <br>
&quot;Capture the beauty of the land,&quot; the editors <br>
had proclaimed by phone and we swore that we would, by God.  <br>
With highland clansmen assembling in the hills we take the cameras outside...  <br>
The soot-black Coal Beast of Galway is chugging up one side of the hill, <br>
Dr. Ignatius in his El Camino coming up the other, <br>
the clansmen with their broadswords waiting atop, <br>
and our cameras are loaded and... <br>
IT WAS TERRIBLE; <br>
Dr. Ignatius hanging, tongue-out bleeding from the half-open door; <br>
the Coal Beast dismembered and puffing smoke, <br>
its furnace punctured by edged weapons; <br>
forty dead clansmen on the bonnie hillside, <br>
brother and father and son.  <br>
Somehow, we pack up the van and return to the hotel <br>
for developing and copywriting and phone calls <br>
to New York, New York, USA . . .<p>

when people created simple wars and zany tigers<br>

<A NAME="4"><h2>THE ONLY VOWEL IN WHIRLIGIG</h2></A>

O the buffalo sings<br>
and my heart falls down<br>
a clatter of loose boards <br>
a symphony of shards<br>
the whole damn ramshackle shebang<br>
in pieces at my feet<br>
and I can only blush<br>
and look for a shovel<br>
while you stare<br>
and wait for the next course<br>
it should be along any minute<p>

<h2>The moon has an ulcer</h2>
the moon has an ulcer, ben. <br>
I have seen it. <br>
I saw it on February the twenty eight, nineteen seventy nine. <br>
I saw it up there as clear as the nails in Jesus hands. <br>
I saw it as clear as the blood running down his side. <br>
I have seen it. <br>
And I don't want no ulcer, ben. <p>

That's why I got this thing for bread, ben. <br>
I got this thing for bread like an alcoholic got a thing for whiskey.<br>
I got a thing for bread like a cigarette smoker has for cigarettes, ben.  <br>
I got a thing for bread like Jesus got for sinners.  <br>
I got a thing for bread like a pot addict got for pot, ben.  <p>

And that's why its bad you know, ben.  <br>
Because I go into the grocery store and that's all I can get is bread, <br>
I’ll spend all the money in my pocket.<br>
The change from my shoes <br>
And then I got no money for the bills you know ben.  <br>
I can’t pay the bills sometimes, and when you cant pay the bills, well...  <br>
You don't pay the electric, it gets disconnectit.  <br>
You don't pay the gas, it gets disconnectit.  <br>
You don't pay the water, it gets disconnectit.  <br>
You don't pay the phone ben, it gets disconnectit. <br>
You know what you got when it all gets disconnectit<br>
ben?  <p>

You got nothing ben.  <br>
You got nothing except nine tons of ulcer <br>
just like the moon. <br>
You got nothing ben, <br>
just like the good lord jesus<br>
hanging right up there on the cross<br>
plain as I’m talking to you ben.<br>
plain as that.<p>
