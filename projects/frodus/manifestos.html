<h2>Donut Manifesto</h2>

<STRONG>The purpose</STRONG>: to realize eternity through frivolity.<p>

<STRONG>The thought process</STRONG>:<br>
0.  This is not a prescription, it is an interpretation.
<p>
1.  Frivolity is a healthy, sensible, and practical attitude -- 
it is the lighthearted rejection of the rationalization that 
we will not someday die.  It is the realization of our transitory 
nature and as such, it is the ultimate afﬁrmation of life.
<p>
2.  As much can be achieved through frivolity as faith.  Both generate the courage necessary to sustain one through the harshest conditions.
<p>
3.  The frivolous mind is the ultimate critical mind.  All rationalizations cease to exist when we realize that we live a trivial existence and rejoice in it.
<p>
4.  Rejoice in it!

<h2><A NAME="2">Arbitrary Theatre Manifesto</A></h2>
Arbitrary Theatre is not a new trick for the jaded.  It is about the realization 
of the arbitrary nature of creation.  What else is theatre but the adroit manipulation
 of a set of rules for controlling groups of people?  <p>
 Don't get us wrong; we do not decry the arbitrary, we recognize and embrace it.  The manifestation of Big-A Theatre is in the discovery, elaboration, and celebration of tools and methods.  It's a rev-olution -elation of process over form.  
The foundations of creation have been plumbed by the futurists, the dadaists, the deconstructionists; the Arbitrary Theatre is not about to reconstruct the foundation.  We are not angry at the superstructure; we want to engineer it, tweak it into more and more fun shapes.  
<p>
<STRONG>The Six Aspects of Big-A Theatre:</STRONG>
<ol>
<li><STRONG>Synergy</STRONG>.  Knowing the whole and a few of the parts and extrapolating the behavior of the rest.  (An example: the practice of starting with a title and documenting the attempt to figure out what it means.)
<li><STRONG>Intuition/Dream</STRONG>.  It is essential that the intuitive dream voice is not drowned out by method or convention.  The intuitive dream voice must be incorporated into the method.
<li><STRONG>Humility</STRONG>.  The arbitrary artist must place just enough stock in the artist's place in the process.  
<li><STRONG>Synthesis</STRONG>.  Compression.  Recognizing/challenging the context-shifting sophistication of the audience.
<li><STRONG>Cybernetics</STRONG>.  Augmentation of the conceptual space by any and all means.
	<ul>
	<li>Software tools
	<li>Educational platforms
	<li>Collaboration
	</ul>
<li><STRONG>Artifact</STRONG>.  How can one believe that things can change if we do not have models to pawn off to the future?  We are not angry at museums or churches; both have their place in the process.  However; for the sake of the process both must be used properly.
</ul>
Big-A Theatre is a theatre of triangles.

<h2><A NAME="3">Mediated Human Interaction Manifesto</A></h2>
<li>Talk-show partitioning of human and political interactions into 'problem' 
and 'solution' is dangerous to the individual and to the process of human evolution.
<p>
<li>As a more responsible member of the media, we posit a process of creation that starts by presupposing 'solutions' to all 'problems' posed by the less-responsible members of the media. It is in this way that our working process can be called political.
<p>
<li>In light of electronic media's unmatchable ability to modify and replicate itself, we have no choice but to use it, but in such a manner as to create individual human experiences.
<p>
<li>Framing and amplifying human experience at a moment is the simple goal of the process.
<p>
<li>The complex goal of the process is a secret.
