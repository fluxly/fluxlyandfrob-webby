<h2><A NAME="2">HE'S COMING: a Frodus play</A> </h2>

(The scene is a room littered with various objects; telephone, a letter, 
a window, a note stuck to the wall with a knife, etc.  
Character ONE is sitting, despondently performing some thoughtless action as 
if everything is out of his control.  Character TWO enters, breathless and frantic)<p>

<STRONG>TWO</STRONG>: He's coming... Mrs. White said she saw him pulling out of the Arby's parking 
lot... I knew he'd come, I knew he'd find us (hits his fist into his palm. Picks 
up telephone)  Hello? ... Yes.  (Hangs up)  Mr. Green says he saw him pulling out 
of the Burger King drivethrough.  I knew he'd come (Paces. Picks up letter.  
reads out loud) "To whom it may concern, He's coming your way.  I saw him in 
his Ford Granada pulling out of the Newport Creamery.  Love Ms. Brown" 
He's coming.  I knew he'd come. (note that TWO is distressed rather than 
pleased by this news.  Paces.  Takes note from knife) "He's coming.  Last 
I heard he wanted to beat you up. I saw him waiting in line down at the Dunkin 
Donuts.  Watch your back. Mr. Black." He is coming. <p>
 (etc. etc.  until...) <p>
<STRONG>TWO</STRONG>  (Looking out window): He's here!  (ONE and TWO bolt offstage.  A GIANT DONUT barrels onto the stage, brandishing a club, he poses menacingly for one dramatically lit moment, then CURTAIN)

<A NAME="3"><h2>Mr. Trim Slacks Ordeal</h2></A>

Players:
<li>Barry
<li>Waitress
<li>Mr. Trim Slacks (Trimmy?)
<li>Mr. Fancy Pants
<li>Ms. Smarty Pants<p>

Props:
<li>pizza
<li>table, chairs
<li>coffee
<li>lint remover<p>

Mr. Trim Slacks is a man with nice slacks and a white bodysuit 
(to accentuate his slacks).  He is waiting for his friend BARRY.  
Now, Mr. Trim Slacks' pair of slacks (or shirt) is clearly marked on the side, 
in glittery letters &quot;MR. TRIM SLACKS.&quot;  Barry is supposed to meet T.S. 
at a cafe but he is late.  T.S. has to wait, giving the audience a good chance to 
get to see his slacks and the lettering.  T.S. might be whistling something 
ridiculous, or there might be music playing.  More likely (knowing him) he is
 removing lint from his slacks with a lint remover.<p>

Barry finally shows up and the two sit down at a table for some coffee.  Mr. T.S. immediately gets annoyed at Barry when he asks him whether he returned his lint remover (he forgot).  Luckily (says T.S.) he bought another one.   T.S. sits down and then stands up quickly, annoyed, and announces that he has sat in something &quot;moist.&quot; He shows the audience a big brown wet spot on the back of his slacks.  He should whine etc. and waitress should come over.  Anyway, he cleans the chair off and sits back down. 
<p>
The two continue conversing but almost immediately, Barry spills a cup of coffee on T.S's slacks.  He bolts up again whining: &quot;MY SLACKS!&quot;  On getting up, he bumps into the passing waitress who spills soup or coffee or food on his pants. 
<p>
They begin to clean the mess up when who should enter but Mr Fancy Pants.  He has VERY flaming fancy pants (also labelled)!  T.S. shouts &quot;YOU!&quot; and points an accussing finger. Mr. Fancy Pants seems surprised but mutually angry.  The two have some mysterious bitter feud happening between them - they square off, grab each other, wrestle for a bit until they hit a table and more coffee or something spills on both their pants.  
T.S: MY SLACKS! <p>
F.P: MY PANTS!  <p>
T.S: (angry) : No one asked you to come here, why don't you just leave?! <p>
F.P: I will! etc.  He starts to leave when... <p>

Ms. Smarty pants enters.  S.P.: Nice slacks, big boy!  (She begins ridiculing mr trim slacks.)
<p>
He says &quot;I thought I told you never to come back here!!&quot;  They wrestle &amp; mr fancy pants joins in... all three end up with pizza on their pants... 
<p>
All: Gross!<p>

<p>

<h4>Part III. ACTION</h4>

* The Halfwit (Joe Auger) finds a baby in a basket washed up on the bank of the river. The golden donut has been stuffed in the baby's basket as if it were hidden in a hurry.  The Halfwit adopts the baby and discards the golden donut.
<p>
* The golden donut rolls to the crossroads where it is found by famous bluesman Kingfish Lear (Keith Munslow) who proceeds to tell us his life story. In the distance, we hear noises from the Forest of Crazy People.  Far in the distance, we see Takasiki (Jon Lax) - a denizen of the forest - preparing his dinner.
<p>
* OVERTURE REPRISE. Her Son appears to the Halfwit as if in a dream.  Perhaps he is accompanied by another dream-like person, perhaps not.
<p>
* The Zen Psychotic (Manny Pombo) is making egg sandwiches.  Perhaps they are for himself or perhaps they are for the local militia forming to protect the golden donut from roving bands of renegade soldiers. His friend is a Man who Loves His Money (Scott Lapham).

<h4>Part V. MORE ACTION</h4>

* The halfwit accidentially visits the Oracle (built by Susan Clausen) with the baby in the basket and is accidentially revealed the trick to the secret of the golden donut.  Kingfish Lear wanders by and deposits the golden donut in a trash barrel.
<p>
* Fireman Bob destroys the egg sandwiches (he burns them) intended for the local militia. Mimi (Jenny Killenberg) finds the golden donut in the trash and brings it home with her.
<p>
* Song of the Renegade Soldier (Jeremy Woodward)
<p>
* A low frequency Storm (played by Rick Massimo) rolls in, catching Mimi and the Halfwit on their way home.  They return to the Man Who Constantly Adjusts His TV (Russell Kellogg) who is adjusting his TV. Mimi, who apparently has taken a bite from the golden donut, collapses and soon after dies in bed.  The Storm continues for several minutes.
<p>
* A sweet melody appears out of the storm-it is the Kiwi Boy song (Kate Lohman). OVERTURE REPRISE: HerSon appears a second time. The halfwit is holding the baby, now revealed to be Kiwi Boy.  Fireman Bob destroys the golden donut by burning it.

<p>
<p><strong>ONE</strong> tips his Ovaltine over into his lap.  
<p><strong>TWO</strong> (after a pause): What'd you do that for?
<p><strong>ONE</strong> (pause): Because I'm wearing Spongepants. 
<p><strong>THREE</strong> deliberately tips his Ovaltine over into his lap.
<p><strong>TWO</strong> (pause): What'd you do that for?
<p><strong>THREE</strong> (pause): Because I'm wearing Spongepants.
<p><strong>TWO</strong> (thoughtful pause): Well I don't have any Spongepants.  
<p>(<strong>TWO</strong> takes Yellow Pages, looks up Spongepants.)
<p><strong>TWO</strong> (on phone): Hello? How can I get Spongepants? ... You'll send some? How much? ... $20 ... OK ... (<strong>ONE</strong> and <strong>THREE</strong> are meanwhile spilling more Ovaltine on their Spongepants)
(A box of Spongepants slides across stage before phone is put down.)
<p><strong>TWO</strong>: Oh boy! (opens box of Spongepants) Wait! These aren't Spongepants! These are Breadpants! (though disappointed, he puts them on and sits back down)

<p><strong>ONE</strong>: What's that you're wearing?

<p>(<strong>ONE</strong> and <strong>THREE</strong> continue eating/spilling Ovaltine)
<p><strong>ONE</strong>: Do you know how to make oatmeal?
<p><strong>THREE</strong>: No.  He was the only one who made the oatmeal.
<p><strong>ONE</strong>: Yeah. (Looks down into oatmeal) I guess we should try to find him...get him to come back to make our oatmeal...
<p>(<strong>ONE</strong> and <strong>THREE</strong> get up and lumber over to the secret spot where Breadpants are more fashionable then Spongepants. They uncover the secret spot so that it is in plain view. <strong>TWO</strong> is huddled up with many rubber ducklings.)
<p><strong>TWO</strong> (sulking): what?
<p><strong>ONE</strong>: You have to make the oatmeal.
<p><strong>TWO</strong>: No! Go away! I'm happy here! You go away! You go pour Ovaltine on your Spongepants, I don't care. I've had it with that place, I'm starting a new life! Go away!
<p><strong>ONE</strong>: You have to make the oatmeal. (<strong>ONE</strong> and <strong>THREE</strong> drag <strong>TWO</strong> from the spot.  <strong>TWO</strong> is clutching at the duckies)
